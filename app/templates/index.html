    <h2>What is Code Analysis?</h2>
    <p>
        Code analysis examines software code to identify potential problems or
        errors, verify that it adheres to coding standards, and ensure that it
        is high-quality. Code analysis can be performed either statically by
        examining the code without executing it or dynamically by executing it
        and analyzing its behavior while running.
    </p>

    <h2>Why do we need meta analysis?</h2>
    <p>Once you deploy a smart contract to the blockchain it is immutable, so all bugs has to be detected beforehand.
    </p>

    <h2>Tools used in meta analysis</h2>
    <h3 class="tool">Slither</h3>
    <p>Slither is an open-source smart contract analysis tool that statically
        analyses the code. Slither takes Solidity Abstract Syntax Tree(AST)
        developed by Solidity Compiler from the source code as input. Slither
        tool consists of a set of detectors to detect the vulnerabilities in the
        contract.
    </p>

    <h3 class="tool">Manticore</h3>
    <p>Echidna is designed for fuzzing/property-based testing and developed in Haskell programming language. Fuzzing is
        a technique that includes generating random inputs and makes it easy to automatically generate tests to detect
        violations in assertions and custom properties.</p>
